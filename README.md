## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd vite-threejs-rapier-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Usage

- The main entry point of the application is located in `src/main.js`, where a basic Three.js scene is set up.
- You can create and manage components in the `src/components` directory. The `ExampleComponent.js` file serves as a template for your components.
- Static assets such as images or models should be placed in the `src/assets` directory.
- Customize the visual appearance of the application using the styles defined in `src/styles/main.css`.

## Dependencies

- Three.js: A JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser.
- RAPIER: A physics engine for simulating 3D physics.
